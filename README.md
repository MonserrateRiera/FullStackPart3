# Phone Guide

Project to make my first steps with FullStack applications. It's a simple phonegide where is possible to add a new contact, modify a already introduced contact, filter by name and delete. 
Altought is a small project, I applied the good practices like clean code, clear architecture and isolation of all the components to make it easy to mainain.
I used this application to get started with Node, React and Mongo.
